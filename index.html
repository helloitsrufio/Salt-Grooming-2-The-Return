<!-- TODO: We need to come up with a new layout that is mobile-first. We stopped when we were trying to configure hamburger menu. We didn't figure out how to make the full menu pop out/be a modal or to take it out of the document flow (it is taking space). We need to get the whole checkbox/JS mechanism down. Look up ways to do that. -->
